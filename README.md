# Notification Microservice [Backend]

This service demonstrates the operation of a Kafka consumer in a microservices architecture. It receives a PaymentCreatedEvent object and processes it according to its logic.
In this Git repository, you can find the [PaymentMicroservice](https://github.com/sakovolga/PaymentMicroservice) project, which is a Kafka producer for the NotificationMicroservice.
